# Comprobo Robot Localization Project

### Project Goals: 
This project focuses solely on a particular form of bayesian optimization called a particle filter to localize a neato in a given map. The filter creates a set of random position guesses called particles, and adjusts them using the robot's LiDAR scan data until it converges upon the robot's actual position.
