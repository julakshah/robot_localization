### Project Goals:

This project focuses solely on a particular form of bayesian optimization called a particle filter to localize a robot in a given map. The filter creates a set of random position guesses called particles, and adjusts them using the robot's LiDAR scan data until it converges upon the robot's actual position.

## Code Architecture

The architecture of this project consists of setting up ROS2 topics, initialising particles, updating particles from robot odometry data, weighting the particles
